                  Our migration to microservices completely changed how we build and operate our platform. The new architecture allows us to scale only the services that need it, deploy updates without downtime, and stay resilient even when individual components fail. <br /><br /> The focus on proper service boundaries, API-first design, and observability gave us full control and confidence in our system. This transformation has made our technology truly ready for the future.
